Recognition Transcript for Sriram

This year has been an incredible journey in my career development, and I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to Sriram, our technical lead, whose guidance and support have been instrumental in shaping my path.

As the lead of the ddpappservice (backend) and ddpappweb (frontend) applications, Sriram played a pivotal role in helping me transition toward becoming a full-stack developer—a key focus area set by my manager this year. His patience and expertise stood out as he took the time to explain each component of these applications in great detail, sometimes multiple times, ensuring I fully understood even the most complex aspects.

With Sriram’s guidance, I successfully delivered on a significant goal: the centralization of global variable management within the DDP ecosystem. This accomplishment not only contributed to the team’s success but also laid the foundation for my growth as a full-stack developer.

Sriram’s unwavering support, mentorship, and dedication have been truly remarkable, and I am deeply grateful for his role in my development. Thank you, Sriram, for being a constant source of encouragement and knowledge throughout this journey.

Recognition Transcript for Arun

I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and express my gratitude to Arun, the technical lead for a parallel squad within our domain, EDSO, for his invaluable support and mentorship this year.

With Arun’s support, I was able to achieve a major milestone: the Smart Assistant Integration with SSP. This accomplishment was made possible through his expertise and willingness to ensure I had the insights and understanding needed to succeed.

Thank you, Arun, for your mentorship, patience, and willingness to share your knowledge. Your guidance has had a significant impact on my growth, and I truly appreciate the effort you invested in helping me achieve my goals.
