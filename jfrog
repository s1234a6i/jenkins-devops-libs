To automatically create release bundles in JFrog Artifactory without using external APIs or manual actions, you can leverage JFrog Distribution’s built-in automation features, such as Event-Based Actions (watching repositories) or Artifactory User Plugins.

Steps to Automate Release Bundles in JFrog

1. Set Up Repository Triggers (Event-Based Actions)
	•	Purpose: Automatically create release bundles when artifacts are added to a repository.
	•	How to Configure:
	1.	Log in to your JFrog Artifactory instance.
	2.	Go to Administration > Repositories.
	3.	Select the repository where the artifacts are uploaded (e.g., a release repository).
	4.	Enable the “Watcher” feature:
	•	Navigate to Properties or Event-Driven Actions for the repository.
	•	Configure a watcher to monitor artifact additions or modifications.
	5.	Use the repository event to trigger a custom Groovy plugin script for creating a release bundle (see Step 2).

2. Develop a Groovy User Plugin
	•	Purpose: Automate the creation of a release bundle when artifacts are added to a specific repository.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Navigate to the Artifactory home directory on the server ($JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/plugins).
	2.	Create a new Groovy script, for example, releaseBundleCreator.groovy:

import org.artifactory.api.repo.RepositoryService
import org.jfrog.artifactory.client.model.repository.settings.impl.GenericRepositorySettingsImpl
import org.jfrog.distribution.bundle.ReleaseBundleService

class ReleaseBundleCreator {
    def repositoryService = ctx.beanForType(RepositoryService)
    def releaseBundleService = ctx.beanForType(ReleaseBundleService)

    def afterCreate(Artifact artifact) {
        def bundleName = "release-bundle-" + System.currentTimeMillis()
        def version = "1.0.0"
        def repoKey = artifact.repoKey
        def path = artifact.path

        // Create a release bundle
        releaseBundleService.createReleaseBundle(bundleName, version, repoKey, path, 'description')
        log.info("Release bundle $bundleName:$version created for $repoKey/$path")
    }
}


	3.	Save the script to the plugins directory.
	4.	Restart the Artifactory service to load the plugin.

3. Configure Distribution Rules
	•	Purpose: Automatically distribute release bundles to the desired target repositories.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Go to Administration > Distribution Rules in the JFrog UI.
	2.	Define rules that specify:
	•	The source repository (e.g., release).
	•	The target edge nodes or repositories where the release bundles should be distributed.

4. Test the Automation
	•	Upload an artifact to the repository.
	•	Verify that the Groovy plugin automatically creates the release bundle.
	•	Ensure the bundle is distributed according to the defined rules.

Key Considerations
	•	Permissions:
	•	Ensure the user or service account running the automation has appropriate permissions for release bundle creation and distribution.
	•	Logging and Debugging:
	•	Monitor Artifactory logs to verify the plugin execution and troubleshoot any issues.
	•	Upgrade Compatibility:
	•	JFrog plugins are Groovy-based, and compatibility might vary between JFrog versions. Test thoroughly after updates.
