Here’s a polished version:

“Thank you, Steve, for supporting me throughout the journey of building the Smart Assistant. When we initially had the idea, I couldn’t have imagined it would have this much impact. But you ensured it went through the right channels and received the attention it needed every step of the way. Your guidance and support, especially as I’m new to development, have been invaluable. I’m truly grateful for your encouragement and belief in this project.”
