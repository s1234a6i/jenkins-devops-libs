Excellent point — since this work is aligned with EndGame squad efforts, here is the revised version with the squad name included naturally:

Goal Name:

Provide Continuous Support and Deliver Enhancements & Bug Fixes for DDP Agile CI/CD Pipelines as part of EndGame Squad

Goal Objective:
	•	As a member of the EndGame squad, provide continuous support and deliver timely enhancements and bug fixes for the DDP Agile CI/CD Pipelines and related workflows.
	•	Enable stable, scalable, and efficient pipeline operations while supporting evolving platform and business needs.
	•	Collaborate cross-functionally to unblock teams, improve automation, and maintain delivery velocity through incremental improvements.
	•	Ensure high operational excellence and proactively resolve defects impacting DDP pipeline quality and performance.

Key Results:
	1.	Resolved DDPv4.1 FOSS - Discrepancies in FOSS reported issues, improving accuracy of FOSS scan results (Released on 01/09/2025).
	2.	Added support for new OCP clusters in DDP workflow to enable OCP orchestration (Released on 01/23/2025).
	3.	Expanded support to two additional OCP clusters (Released on 02/20/2025).

Comments:

This goal captures my ongoing engineering contributions as part of the EndGame squad to maintain and enhance DDP Agile CI/CD Pipelines. Through a mix of functional improvements, platform compatibility updates, and performance optimizations, I have supported stability, scalability, and delivery agility for DDP workflows. I will continue driving similar initiatives through the remainder of the year as part of continuous DDP pipeline support.

If you want, I can also give you a version that sounds good for performance reviews (slightly more impact-focused), or one you can reuse in your self-review / year-end summary. Just say if you’d like me to generate that version too!
