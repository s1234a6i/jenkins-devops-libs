I wanted to provide an update on the Windows deployment POC. There has been a complication regarding firewall requests. The requirement is for these to be processed at the subset level instead of the security group or IP level.

While the RE team is requesting us to create or submit these firewall requests, I clarified that we do not own the Jenkins or Windows servers. Our scope is limited to the automation and orchestration aspects, and the rest of the infrastructure setup is considered a prerequisite.

Please let me know if further clarification or alignment is needed on this.
