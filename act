Goal Name:
Upgrade DDPAppService Backend Component to Java 17 and Align with SSP Application Standards

Goal Objective:
Lead the modernization of DDPAppService backend by upgrading from Java 8 to Java 17, aligning with enterprise-wide modernization goals and improving application performance, maintainability, and security.

Evaluate advanced tooling (including AWS Q) to accelerate the transformation and explore intelligent migration options.

Ensure the modernized application backend adheres to SSP application standards to promote long-term maintainability and platform consistency.

Key Results:
Participated in the AWS Q Early Adopters Program to analyze its applicability for accelerating Java 17 migration of DDPAppService.

Conducted in-depth analysis of AWS Q capabilities — identified key limitations, including incomplete unit test generation, inability to handle locally referred libraries, and partial conversion gaps — which impacted its applicability for this complex backend.

Communicated findings to leadership and pivoted to a manual, phased migration approach, refactoring components and updating logic to ensure a robust and standards-aligned Java 17 upgrade.

Aligned migration activities with SSP application standards and modernization practices to ensure a future-proof architecture.

As of mid-year, approximately 50% of the migration effort has been completed. Work will continue through the second half of the year, balancing transformation progress with application stability.

Progress Note (for current status):
AWS Q was initially evaluated as a migration accelerator but due to functional limitations, it introduced complexity and delayed the transformation timeline. By pivoting to a manual phased approach, we have regained momentum, with ~50% of the migration completed to date. The work will continue as a priority, ensuring full Java 17 readiness and SSP standards alignment.

This version clearly shows:
✅ you showed initiative by participating in AWS Q early adopters
✅ you evaluated it rigorously and communicated the limitations (this will show leadership initiative!)
✅ you did not let the blocker stop you → you pivoted and continued progress
✅ it sets the right expectations on why this took longer but frames your handling of the challenge as very professional
