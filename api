Here’s a well-articulated version of your message for Teams:

Hi Team,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m excited to share that the Smart Assistant Tool is now available for exploration in the Dev environment. This tool currently focuses on three key features:
	1.	Help with DDP Pipeline Support
	2.	DSO Customer Care Workflow
	3.	DSO Document Assistance

As discussed, Wednesday will be the cutoff for the MVP release, as we are targeting a deployment date of December 5th.

I encourage you to explore the tool and its feature capabilities. Your feedback is incredibly valuable, especially regarding:
	•	Verbiage: Does the language align with user expectations?
	•	Functional Gaps: Are there any missing functionalities that should be prioritized for MVP?

Please feel free to share your thoughts, suggestions, or observations. I’d love to incorporate any actionable feedback to ensure the MVP meets expectations.

Thank you for your time and support!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
