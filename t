Here’s an updated version with placeholders for the names:

Current AWS Account Management Process:
Right now, we fetch AWS account information from two sources:

	1.	External Source 1 – This data originates from AWS organizations or a database API.
	2.	Cloud Webpage Parsing – We also collect AWS account group names from our cloud webpage (like ****.cloud.com), combining both data sources into a single JSON file. This JSON file is then used in our self-service platform, presenting the available AWS accounts as a dropdown list for users to select from using aliases.

Challenge with the New Cloud Platform:
There is an ongoing initiative to migrate to a New Cloud Platform, which complicates account management. The new platform does not follow the same account naming or aliasing structure as the existing cloud platform. Account information may be set at an application level, and their process for creating names and aliases differs significantly.

Proposed Solutions:

1. Updating the Existing Account Map:
One approach is to modify the current account map and include the new platform accounts. While this ensures all account information remains in one place, there are significant downsides:

	•	Mapping Complexity: The new platform’s accounts don’t follow the same naming and alias patterns as the current cloud platform. This would require extensive conversions to synchronize the data with the existing map structure.
	•	Increased Maintenance: Constant conversions will make future updates and maintenance complex, increasing the risk of inconsistencies or errors.
	•	Not Ideal Long-Term: This solution may cause confusion as we’re mixing two different account structures in a single source, reducing clarity for teams working across both platforms.

2. Creating a New Account Map and Group for the New Platform (Preferred):
A cleaner, more scalable solution is to establish a new map and account group specifically for the new platform. Here’s how this would work:

	•	Separate Data Handling: The new platform’s account data would be fetched and stored in its own structure, without interfering with the current platform’s data. This allows for clear distinction between the two platforms.
	•	Dedicated UI Field: A new UI field would present new platform account data in the dropdown list for use cases specific to the new cloud platform, ensuring users can easily choose the correct account without confusion.
	•	Improved Clarity: Keeping the new platform separate reduces complexity and provides a clear distinction between platforms. It also ensures flexibility as the new platform grows, without disrupting existing cloud operations.

Conclusion:
While updating the existing map is technically feasible, it introduces unnecessary complexity and risks in the long run. Creating a new account group and map for the new platform ensures that both platforms can evolve independently while keeping account management clean and simple. It will provide a clearer, more maintainable solution for the future, ensuring smooth operations for both the current cloud platform and the new platform.

This version avoids using specific names but keeps the concepts clear and understandable.
